# Thirsty-Project1

This project was for our first project in the UNCC BootCamp in Charlotte.

The Thirsty Project is an app where you can search for types of beer, and it will  give you information such as the name, a littel information on the beer
itself, and food that these type of beers go with. It also provides you with a search tab so you can search more information about the been, locations and google
to get more information the user would want

  David Juarez and Courtney Duggins work on the Javascipt, backend,
